# Pydip
Fooling around with creating a Python wrapper for the DAIDE project.

## DAIDE
In 2002, a group of programmers produced the Diplomacy AI Development Environment
(DAIDE), allowing different Diplomacy AI's to compete against each
other. It consists of:
  * a communications model
  * a communications protocol
  * a language in which diplomatic negotiations and instructions
  can be expressed
  
 More information can be found on their [website](http://www.daide.org.uk/index.html).
 
## The project
Pydip is a protocol-wrapper written in Python. This will (hopefully)
make it easier to write my own bots to play Diplomacy using the
DAIDE Server. Currently it is very much a work in progress.

## Getting started
You'll need Python 3 to run things. You'll also need the DAIDE Server, and
I recommend downloading David Norman's DAIDE Mapper as well, which
makes things a lot easier (and more fun). These can be found
[here](http://www.ellought.demon.co.uk/dipai/).

Note that I use [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) to run the DAIDE Server
and DAIDE Mapper, as I prefer to work in Ubuntu. So I can't guarantee
that it'll be easy or straightforward to get started using either the
Server or Mapper in Windows, although it probably should be. If you
use a Mac, I'm really not sure how hard it will be to set things up. Sorry.
